</head>
<body>
    <h1>Production Sync-up Meeting</h1>
    <p>Production sync-up meetings happen every week on Saturday from 5:30 - 6:00 pm. The lead producer is in charge of facilitating this meeting and providing any important announcements. This is a quick meeting over a discord voice channel where we go over updates of each of the producers’ squad member progress of the tasks that were created in Jira. This is also a great source of communication in case there are problems presented or questions that need to be answered. We also go over the agendas of what the Studio-wide meeting would be focusing on tomorrow.</p>
