    <h1>QA 1 + Sprint 2</h1>

    <div class="post">
        <h2>Production Sync-up Meeting</h2>
        <p>The production sync-up meeting was organized to provide updates from each department on their progress with tools such as Jira, Confluence, and Unity Hub editor. The lead producer shared information about upcoming events, which, while not mandatory, were recommended for attendance. These events include lead mentorship sessions, workshop sessions, playtesting sessions, and more. Additionally, updates on departmental progress and the agenda for the upcoming Sunday studio meeting were discussed.
        </p>

        <h2>Leads Meeting</h2>
        <p>The lead meeting focused on discussing new ideas from designer directors, perspectives from programmer directors on implementing changes, updates on art and audio assets from the respective directors, and the overarching theme and narratives of the games. High-priority tasks and issues were identified for implementation to enhance general gameplay. Discussions also revolved around whether certain features were included in the prototype, the project's scope, and any dependencies between departments for feature integration.

    <h2>Studio-wide Meeting</h2>
        <p>During the first Quality Assurance week, a playtest session was conducted using the latest build uploaded to Confluence. The team identified bugs and glitches in the prototype, discussing whether they were incorrect or correct behaviors. This process allowed the QA team to log these observations into the feedback tracker Google sheet, facilitating tracking and resolution by the programming, quality assurance, and production teams.
        </p>

    <div class="post">
        <h2>Organizing Playtest Feedback Tracker</h2>
        <p>The initial responsibility of the quality assurance team was to detail bugs in the Google sheet. Producers then organized this information, modifying sections such as the original issue text, reporting source, playtest reporter, and other relevant details. This organization made it easier to add issues to Jira, where programming directors could assign them for resolution.

        <h2>Art and Audio Asset List</h2>
        <p>Producers are tasked with updating the art asset list, including names, types, and other details, and creating Jira tasks for them. Art directors oversee this process, adding additional details like sprint assignments and estimations. The audio asset list follows a similar process, with modifications needed for asset ID, name, time estimates, and other details. The art director also oversees this process, deciding on sprint tasks.

        <h2>Logging and Updating Tasks on Jira</h2>
        <p>The process of logging and updating tasks on Jira involves reviewing design documents, playtesting, conducting squad meetings, and completing a task breakdown implementation documentation. This thorough process helps in identifying bugs from playtests and new programming implementations needed for gameplay improvements.
