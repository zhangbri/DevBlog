        <h2>Leads Meeting</h2>
        <p>The meeting focused on key areas such as playtesting, production process improvements, and the detailed goals across design, 
           programming, art, and audio. The agenda included organizing feedback through a playtest form, scheduling a comprehensive playtest 
           with Cam, and revising the production workflow for efficiency. The team aimed to refine game mechanics by integrating diverse player 
           movements, weapon types, projectiles, and developing complex enemy AI with a variety of attacks and movements, including a challenging 
           boss. Level design goals were ambitious, aiming to create a seamless game loop with multiple stages, a shop, and a boss level, 
           complemented by a basic yet functional UI/UX design. The programming efforts mirrored these goals, focusing on implementing these 
           features robustly. On the art front, plans were made for finalizing sprites, animations, and concept art to bring the game's visual 
           elements to life, while the audio team focused on creating immersive sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
