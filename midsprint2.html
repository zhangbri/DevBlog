        <h2>Leads Meeting</h2>
        <p>The meeting focused on key areas such as playtesting, production process improvements, and the detailed goals across design, 
           programming, art, and audio. The agenda included organizing feedback through a playtest form, scheduling a comprehensive playtest 
           with Cam, and revising the production workflow for efficiency. The team aimed to refine game mechanics by integrating diverse player 
           movements, weapon types, projectiles, and developing complex enemy AI with a variety of attacks and movements, including a challenging 
           boss. Level design goals were ambitious, aiming to create a seamless game loop with multiple stages, a shop, and a boss level, 
           complemented by a basic yet functional UI/UX design. The programming efforts mirrored these goals, focusing on implementing these 
           features robustly. On the art front, plans were made for finalizing sprites, animations, and concept art to bring the game's visual 
           elements to life, while the audio team focused on creating immersive sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.

        <h2>Task Breakdown Implementation Questions Documentation</h2>
        <p>During the design presentation, comprehensive updates on the enemy and boss design documentation were shared through links to slides and 
           documents, with specific notes on the need for naming a Debuffer enemy and detailing the Warlock's idle animation as a slight levitation. 
           The presentation also covered the finalization of the last two boss attack patterns, balancing, and finalizing design documents for enemies 
           and bosses. Questions about the Debuffer enemy's aura, enemy HP and Attack DMG display, and balancing for infinite maze progression were 
           discussed, alongside decisions related to UI/UX, player power scaling, and dependencies between levels/systems. The asset breakdown 
           highlighted the programming team's efforts to complete enemy and boss movesets, fix AI bugs, and integrate art and audio, including 
           completing concept art and animations for enemies and bosses, adding sprites to a Google Drive folder, and composing music for the main 
           menu, general gameplay, and the main boss theme, ensuring a cohesive development process across all departments.

        <h2>Industry Playtest with Jeffrey - Chimeric</h2>
        <p>On Sunday, March 3rd at 5pm, Nigel Charleston, a former programming director, 494 IA, and current XR software engineer at Qualcomm, conducted 
           a playtest of Project Classic. His feedback highlighted several areas for improvement and praise. Charleston noted the game's movement mechanics 
           were enjoyable, but found the use of different weapons non-intuitive and the projectiles too slow, suggesting the game lacked challenge. He 
           recommended adding more enemies with improved stats to enhance the game's difficulty and making the ninja class's unique features more prominent. 
           While finding the movement fun, he suggested it could be made more weighty to fulfill a "power fantasy" where players feel empowered decimating 
           hordes of tougher enemies. He appreciated the level design, particularly the handcrafted levels, despite noticing some repetition. The combo weapons 
           system was seen as cool, but Charleston stressed the need for a tutorial to better explain it. His final thoughts included adjusting the difficulty 
           to incentivize the use of more powerful weapons, exploring more with the ceiling stick platform, diversifying level designs, and clarifying class 
           effects. He also reported bugs related to character mobility, weapon selection, spike traps not dealing damage, and various issues related to the 
           debug menu, damage inconsistencies, an invincible tank, level generation errors, and problems returning to the main menu.

        <h2>Logging and Updating Tasks on Jira</h2>
        <p>The methodical process of recording and updating tasks in Jira involves a detailed examination of design documents by producers, participation in 
           playtesting sessions, holding detailed discussions in squad meetings, and resolving any arising questions. This systematic strategy is crucial for 
           pinpointing and rectifying bugs, as well as incorporating new programming features essential for refining the gameplay experience. Emphasizing the 
           importance of early bug detection and resolution, the approach taken by the programming team is proactive, aiming to prevent potential issues and 
           ensure a smooth gaming experience. This includes the design of two enemy types and the development of five distinct boss attack patterns, alongside 
           the creation of sound effects for the movement and projectiles of enemies and bosses, all of which are pivotal for bringing the game's adversaries to life 
           and enhancing the overall player engagement.

        <h2>Mid-week Update Checkup</h2>
        <p>During the midweek check-up, the focus was primarily on developing the Boss Sprite and designing keys, with significant progress made towards completing 
           the idle animation. The immediate tasks involve organizing the boss's limbs into layers for animation purposes and making slight adjustments to the color 
           palette. Although still in the early stages, work has begun on a unique rain attack for the boss, aiming to finalize this along with other boss attacks 
           and augments in the coming week. There's also consideration being given to the creation of specific boss rooms, contingent on current availability. 
           Additionally, advancements have been made with the Warlock enemy, particularly in refining its teleportation mechanics for smoother movement, with most of 
           its essential functions already implemented.

        <h2>Playtesting Project Classic Prototype</h2>
        <p>The playtest of this game prototype reveals a platformer-style environment with pixel art design. The images depict a character navigating through levels with 
           various obstacles and enemies. One image shows the character avoiding circular saw blades on platforms, suggesting precision and timing are key gameplay mechanics. 
           Another showcases an encounter with a boss emitting a ring of fire, indicating a need for strategic movement and perhaps a pattern recognition challenge for the player. 
           Additionally, there's a snapshot of the character facing enemies that resemble knights, which may test the combat system's efficacy. Finally, an image with a different 
           boss unleashing multiple projectiles in a cross pattern adds variety to the boss fights, implying a more complex dodge mechanic. Together, these images hint at a game that 
           combines traditional platforming with combat elements, challenging the player with a mix of strategic movement and action-based gameplay.
